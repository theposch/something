2023 Square Strategic Priorities                                              go/sq2023priorities


Our strategy remains unchanged. To reiterate, the TL;DR is:
* Sellers need an overwhelming number of tools in order to operate effectively and none of them work well together—this is the problem we’re solving.
* We’re building an integrated ecosystem of solutions for commerce, customers, staff, and banking.
* We’re taking a differentiated, platform-based approach. 
* We have a significant market opportunity with multiple vectors for growth.
* We’ve built a scalable, multifaceted growth engine. 
* We have compelling unit economics.
While our business is strong with compelling unit economics, we’re not immune to the broader macro environment. Inflation is at historical highs in many of the markets we operate in, our employee costs are rising (i.e. more cash based compensation and higher healthcare costs), and many economists are forecasting a coming recession. As a result, we are moderating our planned near term level of investment to continue to balance the growth and profitability of the business. We plan to keep Square headcount flat relative to EOY 2022 with some teams shrinking through natural attrition and others with modest growth. While we can never fully predict the future, our continued discipline has enabled us to grow responsibly and avoid having to take the more drastic measures (like layoffs) that other companies have recently taken. Depending on what happens in the macro environment, we may have room to make incremental investments later in the year. 


Enabling Omnichannel remains the top priority. Consumer demand for omnichannel continues to grow. The consumer e-commerce spending growth curve has moderated back to the pre-pandemic trajectory, but the ability to meet buyers where they are and serve them across multiple channels remains an important priority for sellers. We need to continue to invest in omnichannel commerce inclusive of in-store, online, social, and messaging in order to help sellers never miss a sale and operate more efficiently with less staff. 


We’d paused much of the work to converge the ECOM commerce platform with the broader Square Commerce Platform as we sprinted to launch timely features for sellers during the pandemic. In 2023, we’re going to refocus on commerce platform convergence with the goal of all new sellers on a single commerce platform for Items, Orders, Fulfillment, Reporting, and Taxes by end of the year. go/so-eco-cohesion 


We continue to believe that a multi-POS ecosystem enables us to better serve specific verticals than a single POS that tries to be all things to all businesses. However, today there are frustrating feature gaps that sellers encounter when moving from our original Square POS to one of our vertical specific POS’s and/or from Stand to Register. Much of this is a result of technical divergence in our apps. We will focus on closing these gaps through more technical convergence and a more coordinated operating model across our point of sale products. go/xpos  


We will continue to invest in and iterate on our hardware portfolio in order to streamline and simplify. We will update Reader to gear it more towards both US and international markets through added reliability and a simple display and PIN pad (R13). [a]We will replace Terminal with a more mobile and multi-functional device (T3) including a barcode scanner[b] and an accessory to support the countertop use case. We will focus our countertop offering on a new version of Register (X3) that mimics and replaces S3 and S3 Mount but as an all-in-one product versus a bring your own device product. These are all multi-year programs / investments with T3 expected to ship in 2024 and R13 and X3 expected to ship in 2025. go/hardware_strategy 


Finally, we will invest in the seller experience for Marketplace. Marketplace is the two-sided network we’re building to connect Square<>Afterpay<>Cash. We will converge the public website, onboarding, and reporting experience for Afterpay, Square and Cash App Pay sellers so sellers can discover our full ecosystem and view sales across these channels. go/sqapcamarketplace$ This integration will also provide Square sellers with new tools to reach both existing and new buyers in Cash App. go/buyerapp 


Growing Upmarket is our second priority for 2023. Our target larger sellers are those with GPV from $250K to $20M which are still considered SMBs externally. These sellers represent the vast majority of the potential addressable market. These business owners are busy and most are not actively shopping for new solutions. In order to win a larger share of existing businesses we need to build a strong outbound Sales function. This includes continuing to strengthen our sales operations, verticalizing our salesforce, and automating workflows. We also need to better tailor the experience for inbound demand to reflect sellers’ business type and size through the full funnel from awareness -> consideration -> usage. This is inclusive of efforts across Marketing, Sales, Customer Success, and Product. To do this, we will focus on key audiences where we have the strongest upmarket fit.


We will converge our currently disparate back office mobile efforts into a single back office mobile app for owners, managers, and employees. In 2023, we’ll combine the Team App and Crew App into Team App and combine the Banking App and Dashboard App in the Dashboard App. In 2024, we’ll combine the Team App and the Dashboard App. go/sq_bo_app


Finally, in order to attract and retain QSRs as they scale through franchising, we will continue to build out our Franchise Suite. By the end of 2023, we will support self-serve franchise onboarding and seamless central management and orchestration of catalog, customers, reporting, loyalty, and gift cards across all sales channels[c]. 


Going Global is now our third priority. After a rapid pace of expansion in 2021 and 2022, we’re pausing new market entry for 2023 to focus on our existing markets - inclusive of our recently launched markets. France and Spain aren’t yet performing as forecasted. We’ve invested more than originally forecasted in new markets and even with the higher investment the growth in these markets has been lower than planned. We need to iterate on our product, pricing and packaging, and go-to-market approach. We’re going to try new tactics including, but not limited to, more aggressive hardware seeding programs and local / targeted activations and sales versus nationwide approaches. 
[d]


We will not launch in Portugal or Mexico in 2023. We’ll revisit the timing of a launch in Mexico and the roadmap for new market expansion mid next year. We will continue to close product parity gaps in existing international markets and close market specific product gaps such as support for a sales recording module (SRM) in Quebec[e]. Product teams are encouraged to prioritise[f] (see what i did there) the requests from international PMMs. go/2023-intl-product-requests


In closing, while we’re moderating planned investment for 2023 we remain focused and excited about the significant long term market opportunity ahead of us. We have products that our customers love, we’re on the verge of completing major milestones in our bills to orders migration which will unblock long requested features, we’re seeing positive recent trends in Ireland which may indicate that we just need to give France and Spain a little more time before they take off, we’re making steady week-over-week progress on building a strong sales machine, and the combination of Square<>Afterpay<>Cash App via Marketplace has the potential to unlock a whole new vector of growth. Onward!
